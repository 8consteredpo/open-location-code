In this article, we will show you how to use Monacor CAAD 4.2 LS-Boxen Berechnungsprogramm to build your own speaker cabinet step by step.
 
## Step 1: Choose the Type of Speaker Cabinet
 
The first step is to choose the type of speaker cabinet you want to build. Monacor CAAD 4.2 LS-Boxen Berechnungsprogramm can calculate six types of speaker cabinets: closed, bass-reflex, band-pass, compound, transmission line and horn[^1^]. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on your preferences and requirements.
 
For example, if you want a simple and compact speaker cabinet with good bass response, you might choose a closed cabinet. If you want a more efficient and louder speaker cabinet with deeper bass extension, you might choose a bass-reflex cabinet. If you want a speaker cabinet that can produce high sound pressure levels with low distortion, you might choose a horn cabinet.
 
To choose the type of speaker cabinet, you need to open the software and click on "New" in the menu bar. Then, you will see a window where you can select the type of speaker cabinet from a drop-down list.
 
## Step 2: Enter the Speaker Parameters
 
The next step is to enter the speaker parameters that you want to use for your speaker cabinet. Monacor CAAD 4.2 LS-Boxen Berechnungsprogramm has a database of over 400 speakers from Monacor and other brands that you can choose from[^1^]. You can also add your own speakers to the database by entering their parameters manually.
 
To enter the speaker parameters, you need to click on "Speaker" in the menu bar. Then, you will see a window where you can select the speaker from the database or enter its parameters such as impedance, resonance frequency, Q factor, efficiency, etc.
 
## Step 3: Calculate the Speaker Cabinet Dimensions
 
The third step is to calculate the speaker cabinet dimensions that will optimize the acoustic performance of your speaker. Monacor CAAD 4.2 LS-Boxen Berechnungsprogramm can automatically calculate the optimal dimensions based on the speaker parameters and the type of speaker cabinet[^1^]. It can also take into account the complex requirements concerning speaker dimensions, volume and bass-reflex openings[^1^].
 
To calculate the speaker cabinet dimensions, you need to click on "Cabinet" in the menu bar. Then, you will see a window where you can view the calculated dimensions such as height, width, depth, volume, etc. You can also adjust some parameters such as damping material, wall thickness, etc.
 
## Step 4: Design the Crossover Network
 
The final step is to design the crossover network that will divide the audio signal into different frequency bands for each speaker driver. Monacor CAAD 4.2 LS-Boxen Berechnungsprogramm can calculate four types of crossover networks: first order (6 dB), second order (12 dB), third order (18 dB) and fourth order (24 dB)[^1^]. It can also automatically create a parts list for the construction of the crossover network[^1^].
 
To design the crossover network, you need to click on "Crossover" in the menu bar. Then, you will see a window where you can select the type of crossover network from a drop-down list and enter the crossover frequency for each driver. You can also view the frequency response and impedance curve of your speaker system.
