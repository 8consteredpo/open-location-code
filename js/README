This is the Javascript implementation of the Open Location Code API.

The library file is in src/openlocationcode.js.

Unit tests are included and can be executed by installing gulp, gulp-qunit
and gulp-util and running gulp. Unit tests are automatically run on pull
and push requests and visible at https://travis-ci.org/google/open-location-code.

Example web pages illustrating converting map clicks to Open Location Codes,
and using Googles Maps API to extend place codes to full codes are in the
examples/ directory.
