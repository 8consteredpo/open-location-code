This is the Javascript implementation of the Open Location Code API.

The library file is openlocationcode.js.

Unit tests are included and can be executed by loading test.html in a
browser.

Example web pages illustrating converting map clicks to Open Location Codes,
and using Googles Maps API to extend place codes to full codes are in
example1.html and example2.html.
