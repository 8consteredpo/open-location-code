These links are examples of what is known as software piracy, the unauthorized copying, distribution or use of software, games, movies or other digital products. Software piracy is illegal and unethical, and it can have negative consequences for both the creators and the users of the pirated products.
 - For the creators, software piracy means losing revenue and recognition for their work, as well as facing legal risks and reputational damage. Software piracy also discourages innovation and creativity, as it reduces the incentive to invest in research and development.
 - For the users, software piracy means exposing themselves to malware, viruses, spyware and other security threats that can harm their devices and data. Software piracy also deprives them of the benefits of official support, updates and warranties that come with legitimate products.
 - For the society, software piracy means undermining the rule of law and the respect for intellectual property rights, as well as harming the economy and the environment. Software piracy reduces tax revenues and job opportunities, and increases energy consumption and carbon emissions.
  
Therefore, it is important to avoid software piracy and to support the legal and ethical use of software, games, movies and other digital products. There are several ways to do this:
 - Educate yourself and others about the dangers and consequences of software piracy, and the benefits of using legitimate products.
 - Purchase or download products only from authorized sources, such as official websites, online stores or physical retailers.
 - Use products only according to their license agreements, and do not share them with others without permission.
 - Report any suspected cases of software piracy to the relevant authorities or organizations.
 - Support the efforts of software developers and publishers to protect their rights and interests.
  
By doing these things, you can help to promote a culture of respect and responsibility for software, games, movies and other digital products. You can also enjoy a better user experience, a safer online environment and a more sustainable digital future.
